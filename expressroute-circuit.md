# ExpressRoute circuit
ExpressRoute circuits represents a <ins>**logical connection**</ins> that connects your on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft through a connectivity provider. Each ExpressRoute circuit consists of two connections to two Microsoft Enterprise edge routers (MSEEs) at an ExpressRoute Location from the connectivity provider/your network edge. Microsoft requires dual BGP connection from the connectivity provider/your network edge â€“ one to each MSEE. You may choose not to deploy redundant devices/Ethernet circuits at your end. However, connectivity providers use redundant devices to ensure that your connections are handed off to Microsoft in a redundant manner. A redundant Layer 3 connectivity configuration is a requirement for our SLA to be valid.

ExpressRoute circuits do not map to any physical entities. A circuit is uniquely identified by a standard GUID called as a service key (s-key). The service key is the only piece of information exchanged between Microsoft, the connectivity provider, and you. The s-key is not a secret for security purposes. There is a 1:1 mapping between an ExpressRoute circuit and the s-key.
